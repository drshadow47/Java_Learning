     *  DESCRIPTION :::
     * Literals in Java:
     * In Java, a literal represents a constant value that can be directly assigned to a variable. Literals can be of various types, including numeric literals, character literals, string literals, boolean literals, and null literals. Here's a breakdown of different types of literals in Java:
     * <p>
     * Numeric Literals: Numeric literals are used to represent numbers. They can be further categorized into:
     * <p>
     * Integer Literals: These are whole numbers without decimal points, such as 42 or -10.
     * Floating-Point Literals: These are numbers with decimal points, like 3.14 or -0.5.
     * Hexadecimal Literals: Represented with a 0x or 0X prefix, like 0xFF (255 in decimal).
     * Binary Literals: Represented with a 0b or 0B prefix, like 0b1010 (10 in decimal).
     * Character Literals: These represent individual characters enclosed in single quotes, such as 'A' or '7'.
     * <p>
     * String Literals: String literals are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes, like "Hello, World!".
     * <p>
     * Boolean Literals: Java has two boolean literals: true and false, representing the boolean values.
     * <p>
     * Null Literal: The null literal represents a reference with no value assigned.
     * <p>
     * Here's an example of using literals in Java:
     *
     * int age = 25;          // Integer literal
     * double pi = 3.14159;   // Floating-point literal
     * char grade = 'A';      // Character literal
     * String message = "Hello, World!"; // String literal
     * boolean isJavaFun = true; // Boolean literal
     * Object obj = null;     // Null literal
     *
     * @param args
